**Welcome to our little community!** We're all about drawing ponies, and helping you to have fun while doing so.

There's a Discord server, a subreddit for critique, and this site which has all kinds of drawing guides and tutorials to help you out.

## Some history

We've been around a fair while, going from Reddit and IRC to Discord.

Here's a short history written by Living_Dead:

> Back, just a few weeks after season one of MLP:FIM had wrapped up and the hype vortex was growing I was looking around Google Plus for some folks interested in ponies. I came across a call that had two folks drawing ponies. They had created a call to discuss how they were dissecting the screenshots from the show because they wanted to learn to draw ponies better. At this point I had not actually given much energy to drawing so this was all new to me. I ended up joining a few more of their calls and started drawing with them.
>
> It was a few weeks later that one of the members, Rankao created the subreddit MLP Drawing School. I learned they were looking for a person to help with a little CSS so signed up to moderate. At first I just helped out with running the subreddit and setting it up while they helped users out with critique.
>
> It wasnâ€™t long after that I, a person with only a few weeks of art experience, was asked to help critique a few pictures. At first I thought I was not ready and had nothing of value to add so I shouldn't be the person helping them. They however saw it differently. They pointed out that I could use the critique as a chance to work through the problem myself and see what answer I can come up with. I can then talk them through my thought process and hopefully something in that mess of words would help.
>
> Turns out they were actually right. I was able to use this conversation with a few artists to reinforce the few things I had learned up to that point and direct me to the gaps in my knowledge so I knew what to work on next. This kickstarted a 12 year journey into art creating and this being heavily involved in this community.
>
> Over those 12+ years I have made some amazing friends, drawn a crazy amount of horse art, gone to cons just to meet up with MLPDS members, critiqued thousands of pictures, created with a few members 300+ hours of youtube videos to provide critique and so much more.
